{"name":"FI-WARE DBA","tagline":"This is DBA, an implementation of FI-WARE DB Anonymizer Generic Enabler, please check: http://wiki.fi-ware.eu/FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Security.Optional_Security_Enablers.DBAnonymizer","body":"# Welcome to DBA, the FI-WARE DB Anonymizer Generic Enabler reference implementation.\r\n\r\nThis project hosts the source code of DBA. This code has been developed thanks to the support of the FI-WARE project, an initiative funded by the European Commission. Please refer to the [FI-WARE website](http://www.fi-ware.org) for more information. \r\n\r\nDBA is a service that helps in data disclosure activities, and in particular when considering, evaluating and applying anonymization strategies. DB Anonymizer DBA GE Reference implementation is designed to be easily reused by other services, compositions or applications. \r\n\r\nDBA is an implementation of the DB Anonymizer GE specification.\r\n\r\n### Why do I need DBA?\r\n\r\nDBA permits to understand if a certain anonymization policy for a dataset should be considered safe or not. The service offers a function that calculates a value, that represents the possibility of data that an attacker can reconstruct from an anonymized dataset content (that is, the re-identification risk).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n### Quick Reference Guide\r\n\r\nDBA has a very simple API. Its main functionality can be used through two simple methods, one to submit a policy to be analysed (together with its associated dataset), the other to retrieve the computation result. Other functionalities exist, please refer to [this link](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/DB_Anonymizer_GE_-_User_and_Programmer_Guide#Developer_Guide) for a list of functionalities and a more detailed explanation.\r\n\r\nIn this example, only the main functionality is demonstrated, the others can be invoked in a similar way.\r\n\r\n1. submitting a policy:\r\n```\r\ncurl \\ \r\n> -F \"policyFile=@.xml\" \\\r\n> -F \"dbDump=@.zip\" \\\r\n> -F \"submit=Submit\" https://[server URL]/[application path]/DBA/evaluatePolicy \r\n```\r\n1. retrieving re-identification risk for that policy:\r\n```\r\ncurl https://[server URL]/[application path]/DBA/getPolicyResult/[GID returned by the previous call]\r\n```\r\n##Manuals\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the [DB Anonymizer FI-WARE page](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/Materializing_Security_in_FI-WARE#DB_Anonymizer_.28Optional_Security_Enabler.29) and especially to [DB Anonymizer User and Programmer Guide](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/DB_Anonymizer_GE_-_User_and_Programmer_Guide) for more information.\r\n\r\nPlease also find the [slides](http://catalogue.fi-ware.eu/sites/default/files/storage/enablers/20121203-FI-WARE-DBAnonymizer-GE.pdf) that were used for DB Anonymizer DBA GE Reference implementation webminars.\r\n\r\nIn using the provided instance, it is important to connect to the SSL-enabled endpoint to ensure the highest confidentiality; however, for testing purposes:\r\n\r\n* a standard HTTP (and not HTTPS) endpoint is made available, at http://[server URL]/services/DBA\r\n* an HTML front-end is presented, just browse to: https://[server URL]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Want to know more?\r\n\r\nMore information on DBA and on the DB Anonymizer GE can be found on the [DB Anonymizer GE Open Specification page](http://forge.fi-ware.eu/plugins/mediawiki/wiki/fiware/index.php/FIWARE.OpenSpecification.Security.Optional_Security_Enablers.DBAnonymizer).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors \r\n[Francesco Di Cerbo] (https://github.com/fdicerbo)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
